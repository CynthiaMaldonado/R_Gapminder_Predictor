# R end to end project: GapminderApp
  
Given at least 3 csvs from Gapminders' website, our app
predicts values of empty cells in one of them based on the information 
in the others. In order to do that, it trains a model with a linear regression to 
obtain the most accurate value according to the country and year on your 
request.
